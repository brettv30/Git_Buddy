## Key Features üîë

- **TortoiseGit Advisor**: Helps you utilize TortoiseGit in your projects with ease.
- **GitHub Navigator**: Guides you through GitHub, from repository management to pull requests.
- **Git Teacher**: Offers detailed explanations, examples, and tips on Git commands and best practices.

## Technical Specifications üí°

- **Vector Database Population**: [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en) & [Progit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) were used as the starting places for a recursive URL search that extracted all important information from each webpage's HTML. [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/) & [TortoiseGitMerge](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegitmerge/) were copied as PDFs and split apart during document chunking. 
- **Document Chunking in RAG**: For the RAG system, document chunks are set to 400 tokens, with a 50-token overlap across documents, optimizing the balance between context and detail.
- **Document Reranking**: The Cohere `Rerank` model is used to rerank the top 100 documents by finding the top five documents most semantically relevant to the query.
- **Embeddings Model**: Utilizes the `text-embedding-ada-002` model from OpenAI for generating document and query embeddings while processing text data.
- **Prompting Methodology**: Adopts few-shot prompting, conversational memory, and additional document context for robust, efficient, and accurate responses.
- **Conversational Memory**: Git Buddy retains knowledge of the seven most recent messages, ensuring relevant and contextual interactions while excluding older chat history.
- **Temperature Setting**: `GPT-3.5-Turbo` operates at a temperature setting of 0.5, balancing creativity and coherence in responses.
